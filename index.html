                His Story 
            </div>
            <p>
                Born on January 5th 1941, Miyazaki grew up during WWII where he was forced to live
                a vigilant life. His childhood comprised of him evacuating to cities around Japan in order
                to escape bombings.

                As a child, Miyazaki aspired to be a managa artist. Since he wasn't good at drawing humans, 
                he focused on drawing inanimate objects like ships and planes. Eventually, he landed a job as 
                an artist for Toei Animation in his 20s.

                He worked on animating films for his company and continued to grow as an artist.
                During his time at Toei he became a chief animator, a concept artists, a scene designer, and a labor dispute leader.

                In 1980, Miyazaki started to work on his own ideas, where he would incorporate his own themes.
                He started by drawing a manga titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which gained popularity 
                and was eventually made into a film.

                In 1985, Miyazaki found Studio Ghibli where he produced films that gained international attention. 
                What makes his film interesting is that he incorporates realistic themes into his films. Some of 
                these themes can be seen to be influenced by his past, such as his stance on anti-war.
