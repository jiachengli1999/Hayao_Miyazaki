                His Story 
            </div>
            <p>
                Born on January 5th 1941, Miyazaki grew up during WWII where he had to
                run away from bombings. These events may have influence his future works. 

                Miyazaki was known for being a perfectionist, and he worked as an animator 
                during his early days. It was not until he found Studio Ghibi that his films 
                started to gain international attention. What makes his film interesting is that
                he incorporates realistic themes into his films. Some of these themes can be seen 
                to be influenced by his past, such as his stance on anti-war. 

                As a perfectionist, Miyazaki wanted to be proud of every single work, since they
                were a reflection of himself. As a result, he was often strict and demanding on his staff.

                "We are born with infinite possibilities, only to give up on one after another"
                Miyazaki believed that making decisions means giving something up, and it is inevitable.
                
                Miyazaki has retired multiple times, but came back to the industry because
                he wants to keep fighting and creating until he dies.

                found Vannevar Bushâ€™s essay to be a revolutionary take on how to make 
                managing information more efficient. Bush argues that technology is advancing, 
                but our way of analyzing and keeping information remains stagnant. It generally 
                boils down to gathering a large amount of information then connecting them.
